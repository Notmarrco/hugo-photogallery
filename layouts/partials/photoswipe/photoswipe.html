<!-- 
    Photoswipe needs height/width of the image, so we have to store it in our data.
    If all the images are the same size (or most of them) we might want to use a default
    size instead of storing the sizes for each image.
    To ease the bootstraping of the template we set default value to portrait 800x1000.
